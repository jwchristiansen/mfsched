# mfsched

Automated scheduling for mentor<>fellow 1:1s from CSV file.

[Live Demo](https://mfsched.herokuapp.com/)

## Use
(1) Upload CSV file:
<div><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/joelc.io/form.png" alt="form" width="250"/></div>

(2) Presto, a schedule:
<div><img src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/joelc.io/schedule.png" alt="form" width="500"/></div>
 
## How It Works
This app generates and displays non-conflicting program schedules that match mentors and fellows for 20-minute meetings held during AM/PM blocks during the program days.

The form rendered at `app/views/programs/index.html.slim` submits a POST requst to `programs#create`. This triggers two primary methods:

`import_csv` ([`app/models/program.rb`](https://github.com/jwchristiansen/mfsched/blob/main/app/models/program.rb))

  - Iterates through the CSV and populates mentors, fellows, and unscheduled meetings into the database.

`schedule_slot` ([`app/models/meeting.rb`](https://github.com/jwchristiansen/mfsched/blob/main/app/models/meeting.rb))

  - Iterates through meetings and schedules them at free times.

Because time slots are stored as simple integers and then arbitrarily assigned via helper in `app/helpers/program_helper.rb`, changing the overall schedule structure is a nominal task. In other words, it is relatively easy and straightforward to add breaks, reschedule AM/PM windows, etc.

## Stack
- Rails 7.0.2.3 (importmaps)
- Ruby 3.0.1
- Stimulus
- Postgresql
- Tailwind
- Make.com (API integrations)
- Rspec (_placeholder setup only_)

## Installation
__(1) Clone__

`git clone https://github.com/jwchristiansen/mfsched.git`

__(2) Directory__

`cd mfsched`

__(3) Bundle__

`bundle install`

__(4) Database__

`rails db:create db:migrate`

__(5) .env__

Create a file called `.env` in the app's root directory and add the file (`.env`) to `.gitignore`.

In `.env`, add a line that reads `PUBLIC_API_KEY=FOOBAR` where `FOOBAR` is the public API key for Make.com scenarios.  

## Server
Install [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) with `gem install foreman` (don't add this in your Gemfile)

Start server with: `foreman start -f Procfile.dev`
  - __Note:__ This bash/zsh alias reduces the above command to two keystrokes ðŸ˜Ž: 
    - `alias fm="foreman start -f Procfile.dev"`

## API Integration
In addition to saving meetings in a Postgres database, this app also exports meetings as rows in [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1noQB3eShTsB-g-K_v3YYRHSvPNPol4ZTvuU1mMTJH70/edit#gid=0). 

The relevant code is at [`app/controllers/programs_controller.rb:20`](https://github.com/jwchristiansen/mfsched/blob/main/app/controllers/programs_controller.rb#L20). It fires a simple JSON array of meetings via HTTPS POST request to a [Make.com](https://make.com) scenario. The Make scenario iterates through the JSON and populates the spreadsheet. This is a simple example, but also a foothold for [thousands of other API integrations](https://www.make.com/en/integrations).

## Style Guide
This application uses [Standard](https://github.com/testdouble/standard) for style, linting, and formatting.

Run and fix with `standardrb` and `standardrb --fix` respectively.

## TODO
Lots.

- Form validation
- Query performance
- Unit and integration tests
- Refactor `app/models/meeting.rb`
- Fix `ActionController::RoutingError (No route matches [DELETE] "/"):` when deleting program
- Design
